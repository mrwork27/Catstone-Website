    <h2>Who we are</h2>

    <h3>Michael</h3>
    <img src="logo.png" width="200" height="40" />
    <p>
      As a lifelong dog lover, Michael only learned to appreciate cats more
      recently. After reading online that cats don't like eye contact, he
      learned to look away to initiate cuddles. It works more often than not and
      he's happier now.

    <h3>Lauren</h3>

    <p>Wanting to save the world's abandoned animals, Lauren joins the Catstone
        team with a passion for all things fluffy. Cats and dogs are her tied second
        favourite animals, only settling behind Llamas - if she could fit one in her house she would!
    </p>

    <h3>Yony </h3>
    
    <p> I believe that when people say that one life is enough to live well, they forget to mention that life is not complete without the love of pets, 
      so if you do not have pets in your life, you should most certainly get one to experience the amazing love!
    </p>

    <h3>Hanna</h3>
    
    <p> Hanna's dream has always been to have a dog, in the meantime she decided to take part in the Catstone project to share her love for animals</p>
